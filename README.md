# Vote Me!

This project demonstrates three different approaches to implementing a voting system using modern web technologies.
Each approach showcases a distinct method for handling votes without a traditional backend server (serverless).

## Approaches

1. **Cloudflare Workers**
   - Cloudflare serverless platform to process votes at the edge, providing fast and scalable handling without managing servers.

2. **Supabase**
   - Supabase, an open-source backend-as-a-service, to store and manage votes using its database and API features, all without custom backend code.

3. **Google Forms**
   - Google Forms to collect votes, making use of Google's infrastructure for data collection and storage, ideal for simple and quick setups.

Each method is implemented in its own folder:
- `with-cloudflare/`
- `with-supabase/`
- `with-form/`

Feel free to explore each approach to find the best fit for your voting needs!
